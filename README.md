# Meanie

## About
Meanie is a boilerplate for developing full-stack modular javascript applications using the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js.

## Installation


## Gulp tasks
Meanie comes with fully configured Gulp tasks that just work out of the box.

### Gulp 4
The gulpfile for Meanie has been configured for use with Gulp version 4. This version is not officially released yet, but you can install and use the alpha version by following  [these instructions](http://demisx.github.io/gulp4/2015/01/15/install-gulp4.html).

## Folder structure
The following is an outline of the folder structure of this boilerplate:

```shell
# Client side code and assets
client

  # This is where your client side Angular application resides. Everything in this folder should be explicitly specific to your application.
  |_ app

    # The home module of your application. Feel free to rename to anything that suits better (e.g. index, dashboard, ...)
    |_ home

    # This folder contains the layout module for you application. It's a good place to store all common SASS stylesheets and templates.
    |_ layout

    # This folder contains an Angular mock backend for your application. You can add new mock modules as needed.
    |_ mock

    # The main navigation module, for application wide navigation logic.
    |_ nav

    # An example secured module.
    |_ secure

    # Any application specific, but shared services, directives and filters that don't belong to one specific module can be placed here.
    |_ shared

    # An example user module implementation.
    |_ user

  # Common (non packaged) services, directives and filters are arranged in this folder. Everything in here is not specific to a particular application and could be recycled in other projects.
  |_ common

  # Static assets for your client application go here. This is a good place to store fonts, images, audio files, etc. Anything in here will be copied as-is to the public folder.
  |_ static

  # Vendor resources reside here. Bower is configured to download all 3rd party resources into this folder, and this folder is excluded from the GIT repository.
  |_ vendor

# Server side code and assets
server

  # This is where your server side Node/Express application resides. Everything in this folder should be explicitly specific to your application.
  |_ app

  # Common (non packaged) node modules are arranged in this folder. Everything in here is not specific to a particular application and could be recycled in other projects.
  |_ common

# Environment configuration (shared by client and server)
env

# Public folder for compiled assets (generated by Gulp)
public

  # Compiled CSS stylesheets
  |_ css

  # Compiled Javascript sources
  |_ js

  # Fonts
  |_ fonts

  # Images
  |_ images
```
